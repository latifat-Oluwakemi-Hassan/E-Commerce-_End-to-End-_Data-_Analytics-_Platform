# 📌 Project Title
## End-to-End E-commerce Data Analytics Platform
## 📖 Project Description
This project analyzes historical e-commerce data to provide actionable insights on customer behavior, sales trends, and revenue performance. It identifies patterns in customer churn, regional sales distribution, purchasing habits, and periods of growth or decline. Additionally, predictive analysis forecasts future sales and customer trends to inform strategic business decisions.

The goal is to turn raw, fragmented data into clear, decision-ready insights that businesses can use to improve service delivery, enhance customer experience, increase retention, and drive sustainable growth.
## Motivation & Problem Statement

Many e-commerce businesses have plenty of data but struggle to use it effectively due to:

Disorganized or incomplete datasets

Lack of reliable analytics pipelines

Difficulty translating insights into actionable strategies

This project was built to bridge that gap by providing a production-style, database-first analytics solution that mirrors real-world business environments.

## Technologies Used

Programming Languages & Libraries:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, OpenPyXL, Pycountry)

SQL

Data Processing & Analysis:

ETL pipelines

Data cleaning and transformation

Databases:

SQLite

Visualization & Reporting:

Plotly

Dash

Streamlit

ReportLab

Other Tools:

Excel (for reporting and pivot tables)

## Project Process

The project follows a structured workflow to turn raw e-commerce data into actionable insights:

1. Data Collection & Cleaning
   
The project uses messy raw e-commerce datasets generated from multiple sources, including:

Customers: 50,500 rows × 24 columns

Orders: 101,000 rows × 24 columns

Products: 10,300 rows × 30 columns

Reviews: 50,400 rows × 20 columns



Remove inconsistencies, handle missing data, and standardize formats.

Integrate all datasets into a unified structure.

2. Database Creation

Design and populate a relational database (.db file) to efficiently store and manage the data.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyze and visualize trends in sales, revenue, profit, and customer behavior.

Identify anomalies, seasonal patterns, and key performance drivers.

4. Insight Generation

Detect patterns in customer churn, purchasing habits, and regional distributions.

Produce actionable insights to guide strategic business decisions.

5. Predictive Analysis

Forecast future sales and customer trends using historical data.

Support planning, marketing, and inventory management decisions.

6. Reporting & Visualization

Build interactive dashboards using Dash and Streamlit.

Generate automated reports for business stakeholders, enabling clear, decision-ready insights.
